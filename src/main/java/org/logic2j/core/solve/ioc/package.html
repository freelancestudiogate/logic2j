The solve.ioc package defines the callback mechanism (inversion of control) between the Prolog
engine and the caller. Solutions are sent from the engine to user code via the SolutionListener interface
and various implementations are provided.

This is the lowest level for obtaining solutions, but not the most convenient to use. Therefore higher-level
utilities are also provided to obtain solution and extract useful information from them.
