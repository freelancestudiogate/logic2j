Things possibly to be done:
---------------------------

- Using Java assertions (but check for recommended / best practices carefully first - and document them), they do not replace exceptions.
- Refactor unit test cases to leverage new JUnit's bundle of hamcrest v1.3
- There is no Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO) yet
- Remove ClauseProviderResolver
- Have a look at Java CDI (JSR ?, JSR 250, instead of Spring) for easier integration with CDI frameworks (see tasks in PrologImpl)
